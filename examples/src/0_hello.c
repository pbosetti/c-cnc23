// * - This "string" is called a string literal. When two string literals are
//     placed next to each other (with no commas in between!) the compiler
//     simply merges them. So "Hello, World!" "\n" becomes "Hello, World!\n".

// now run this command:
//   clang -E examples/src/1_hello.c | code -
// -E: means "preprocess only"
// |: means pass the output (or "pipe") to the next command (code)
// code -: means open a new file in VSC with the output coming from previous
// command
//
// This will open a temporary file with the source after preprocessor.
// You may notice the whole stdio.h included at the begining, 
// also, the GREET preprocessor constant has been replaced in line 12.
// Lines starting with "# " are not compiled and are tags representing 
// preprocessor inserion traces
